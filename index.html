   <h1>About Me</h1>
   <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Hello. My name is David Nzayituriki. I am currently studying Front-End development with Azubi Africa.I started with no experience in web development, so this page is my first execercise in web development. I always wanted to have experience with computers besides using them for my daily work. I always wanted to have something to do with what's happening behind the scenes. Therefore, I discovered that html is the right place to start.</p>
